# flower-farm
Let's grow, grow, grow! You've built a backyard garden with five plots of dirt to plant ðŸŒ·flowers ðŸŒ·in, so get to planting, growing, and earning. Flowers produce âœ¨sparkles âœ¨ you can use to buy new types of flowers. You'll want to get as many types as you can to produce the most âœ¨sparkles âœ¨! 

## About
### goal state
The goal of this game is to grow your flowers and produce sparkles. Flowers need to be watered in order to grow and will only produce sparkles once fully grown. Players only have 3 minutes to grow as many flowers as they can to produce as many sparkles as they can. To start, players are given five seeds to plant in five plops of dirt. They will need to plant their seeds and water their flowers when they are thirsty to get them to grow . Once fully grown, flowers will start to produce a currency of sparkles. 

<!-- A player will "lose" the game if they run out of seeds/flowers. This is possible to do only if the player really wants to lose (ie., they choose to cut all their flowers and not to purchase new seeds in the shop.)  -->

A player will "lose" if they fail to produce the required sparkles in the current wave.

### Verbs
actions that my things can act:
- move (mvp)
  - the player can use the arrow keys to move the farmer left <- or right ->
- plant (mvp)
  - the player can press the  x key while the farmer is in front of a plop of dirt to plant a seed. this will remove one seed from the seed count. planting on an already full plop of dirt will not remove seeds from the seed count.
- water (mvp)
  - the player can press the z key while the farmer is in front of a thirsty seed/sapling/flower to water it. watering an already watered seed/sapling/flower will do nothing.
- grow (mvp)
  - growing removes seeds and saplings(stretch) from the canvas and replaces them with saplings(stretch) and flowers respectively. each has an interval that determines when they grow.
